  "description": "An ExperienceEvent is a fact record of what occurred, including the point in time and identity of the individual involved. ExperienceEvents can be either explicit (directly observable human actions) or implicit (raised without a direct human action) and are recorded without aggregation or interpretation. They are critical for time-domain analytics as they allow for observation and analysis of changes that occur in a given window of time and the comparison between multiple windows of time to track trends.",
