A repository policy is a content policy that applies to all users of the content repository, it includes aspects such as:
 * Versioning - shows how versioning for content stored in this specific part of the repository is behaving.
 * Encryption - shows how content in this part of the repository is encrypted at-rest. Encryption and key-management does not happen in the content repository. Consequently, the versioning properties are not user editable.

Repository policies can be applied for the entire repository, or only for specific directories.
