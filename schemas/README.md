# Schemas

These files represent standard schemas which can be used directly by AEP Datasets or services which require
a single definition which is the same across all organizations that use schema. 

Very few of these exist in AEP today where nearly all Datasets are instead based a custom defined schemas
using the XDM "components" and required composition model.
